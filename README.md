# Playable-Maze-Game
A simple maze game with a very snarky AI.

Part III of the Random-Maze-Generator. With the maze capable of being randomly generated and an ai that is able to solve it,
now we can create a a little game. Now every time the player makes a move, the program can now tell you if you're on the
right path or if you're off course. Fair warning, this ai is quite snarky/rude. 

You can run this program by executing the 'mazedfs.java' file.
